# tipulator
Designed for users to help work out the amount of the bill with tip.
The user must first enter the bill amount.
The user must then rate the service as poor, good or excellent. 
If the service is poor, no tip is added.
If the service is good, 10% of the bill amount is added to the bill as tip.
If the service is excellent, 20% of the bill amount is added to the bill as tip.
User then enters the amount of people splitting the bill.
Once the submit button is pressed, Tipulator then calculates the total with tip and amount per person and displays this on the screen.
